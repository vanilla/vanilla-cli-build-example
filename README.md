# Vanilla CLI example addon

This repo contains parts of an addon to use as an example for the [Vanilla CLI](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/vanilla-cli). It is not a complete addon/theme and will not do much if you install into Vanilla. It's purpose is to illustrate a functioning project structure for the build tool.

The tool itself can be found [on Github](https://github.com/vanilla/vanilla-cli).
